MF-AM Broadcasting Band

The MF AM broadcasting band lies between 530 and 1606,5 kHz, and is divided into 120 channels of 9 kHz bandwidth each. In South Africa, the first channel on 531 kHz is not used for MF broadcasting as the frequency band 526.5 - 535.5 kHz is allocated to mobile telecommunications service. Three of the MF channels have been designated as low power channels where the power may not exceed 1 kW. Currently medium to high power MF-AM transmitting sites are located at Meyerton, Springs, Komga, Ga-Rankuwa and Klipheuwel. The local authority and environmental considerations often limit the establishment of high power MF stations due to the large infrastructure associated with such stations and its interference impact on electronic systems.
South Africa has 37 channels registered with the ITU; of these 11 are in use with powers between 10 kW and 100 kW. At the ITU Geneva '75 Conference for MF-AM planning, it was resolved in the Final Acts that the provisions and resolutions adopted for the benefit of member and non-member states shall not be applied to the Government of the Republic of South Africa. The Authority has already undertaken a process of including all the assignments in the Master Register of the ITU. The South African MF-AM plan includes low power frequencies assigned to Community Radio services. low power for MW applies to 1kW or lower powers.
